## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:
```
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
```

### Database Configuration
The default configuration uses SQLite. For production, it's recommended to use PostgreSQL:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'your_db_name',
        'USER': 'your_db_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_db_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```
